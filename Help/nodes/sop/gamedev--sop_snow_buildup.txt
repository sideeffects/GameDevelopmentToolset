""" Adds geometry to an input mesh that mimics snow buildup """

This is a sample node for a common Houdini use case, modify at will to fit your needs. 

One of the classic Houdini problems is to generate Snow Caps over objects. But there was no built in solution for this until now. 

This works by scattering points on up facing polygons of the incoming mesh, copying some spheres onto those points and then voxelizing and smoothing the result. 

This was original designed and used on our GDC 2019 Unity demo and subsequently released to the public.

@parameters
    == Scattering Options ==
    Spread Angle:
        How far the snow will wrap around the object. 180 means full hemisphere, 0 means only surfaces perfectly facing up. 
    Number of Snow Points:
        How many snow drops to generate on the surface 
    Point Size (Min/Max):
        Size range on each snow drop, which turns into a sphere. 
    == Meshing Options ==
    Smooth Iterations:
        Blur the snow volume 
    Dilate/Erode:
        Grow or Shrink the snow volume
    Blurring Iterations:
        Blur the final generated snow mesh 
    Color:
        Vertex Colors on the output mesh
    == Clean Up ==
    Reduce to # Polys:
        Limit the snow mesh to this polycount
    Boolean Against Original:
        Remove faces that are inside the interior mesh by boolean the 2 meshes together
    Keep Original:
        Output the original input mesh merged in as well
