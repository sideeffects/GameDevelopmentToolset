""" Physically Based Viewport Shader """

This shader was developed as the precursor for the new High Quality Lighting shader in Houdini 17.5 a lot of the calculations are the same with a few differences

* Ambient Occlusion Map Support 
* Realtime Environment Cube Map Blurring 


@parameters
    == Surface ==
    
    === Albedo ===
    Base Color:
        Basic Tint on the Albedo, defaults to .8 to avoid pure whites. 
    Use Texture:
        Enable AO Map
    Texture:
        Albedo Map
    === Roughness ===
    IOR:
        Index of Refraction, similar to the base PBR value of 0.04. High Values refract more light
        
        Note:
            Formula used to convert ior to spec is 
            
            `pow((ior-1)/(ior+1),2)`
            
    Roughness:
        Multiplier over the roughness texture 
    Horizon Smoothing:
        Fade the lighting at steep glancing angles in order to reduce light bleeding (Not reflected in Mantra)
    Invert Roughness:
        Inverts the roughness so it behaves like Gloss (Not reflected in Mantra Shader)
    Use Texture:
        Enable Roughness Map
    Texture:
        Roughness Map
    Channel:
        Which channel from the texture to use as roughness. Helpful if you have packed textures. 
        
    === Metallic ===
    Metallic:
        1 means fully metallic, 0 means dialetric. Generally speaking in between values shouldn't exist in the real world. 
    Use Texture:
        Enable Metallic Map
    Texture:
        Metallic Map
    Channel:
        Which channel from the texture to use as metallic. Helpful if you have packed textures. 
      
        
    === Normal ===
    Enable:
        Enable Normal Mapping
    Texture Path:
        Path for the Normal Map Texture 
    Effect Scale:
        Strength Multiplier
    Flip X:
        Invert the Red Channel 
    Flip Y:
        Invert the Green Channel 
    Use Model's Tangent :
        Use the Model's TangentU Attribute for MikkT Calculations 
        
    === Occlusion ===
    Occlusion:
        Controls the intensity of the AO map
    Use Texture:
        Enable Ambient Occlusion Map
    Texture:
        Ambient Occlusion Map
    Channel:
        Which channel from the texture to use as Ambient Occlusion. Helpful if you have packed textures.        
        
    === Emissive ===
    Emission Intensity:
        How Strong is the emissive(glowing) parts 
    Emission Color:
        The color of the glow
    Use Texture:
        Enable Emissive Map
    Texture:
        Emissive Multiplier (Mask w/ Color)      
        
    === Transparency ===
    Transparency:
        Toggle alpha (transparency) 
        
    == Advanced ==
    Importance Sampled Ambient:
        Use a fancier way of sampling the diffuse information from Environment Lights
    Number of Diffuse Samples:
        Number of Samples of the Environment Light during diffuse calculations
    Importance Sampled Reflections:
        Realtime blurring of the cubemap based on the roughness of the object
    Number of Specular Samples:
        Number of Samples of the Environment Light during specular calculations
    Shade Both Sides As Front:
        Reverses the backsides to ensure they are shaded like the front
