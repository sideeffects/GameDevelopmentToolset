""" The flowmap SHOP is a glsl based viewport shader to preview flowmap shaders. """

The flowmap SHOP is a glsl based viewport shader to preview flowmap shaders. This shader is used in the sop called Flowmap Visualize, which takes vertex colors or a texture representing motion.
This shader will visualize motion by distorting the UVs based on input flowmap data.

@parameters
    Diffuse Texture:
        The diffuse texture visualizing the displacement by the flowmap texture. This is typically a texture resembling water, or an array of arrows to easily identify the direction of motion.
    Diffuse Tiling:
        This controls the tiling amount of the Diffuse Texture. Useful to adjust without having to modify any UV values.
    Flowmap Mode:
        This allows you to specify what kind of data drives the flowmap motion. Color will use the vertexcolors, texture will use the Flowmap Texture parm texture.
    Flowmap Texture:
        When Flowmap Mode is set to texture, this is the texture that will be used to drive motion.
    Time:
        This parameter controls the time in the shader. This needs to be animated for the shader to function properly.
    Speed:
        This controls the speed of the flowmap distortion.
    Distortion:
        This controls the intensity of the flowmap distortion.
