""" The terrain layer export SOP exports a heightfield with the correct settings for Unreal. """

The terrain layer export SOP exports a heightfield with the correct settings for Unreal. It does so by properly orienting the heightfield prior to export, and also remaps it into the expected range (0-256).
This tool is designed to work together with Terrain Layer Import.

@parameters
    == Export ==
    Save to Disk:
        This will export the heightfield to disk.
    Host:
        This allows you to specify if the tool is being used to export a heightfield from Houdini, or Houdini Engine. This is important to have correct in order to prevent rotated heightmaps. The tool should automatically detect what the host is, but its recommended to confirm manually.
    Layer Prefix:
        This is the prefix used for exporting the heightfield maps.
    Heightmap Name:
        The name used for the heightmap.
    Export Folder:
        This is the folder on disk that the extracted maps will be exported to.
    == Tiling ==
    Divide into tiled maps:
        This enables/disables the exporting of maps as tiled maps.
    Tile Method:
        This controls how the heightfield will be cut up into tiles. Either based on size, or on absolute number of chunks.
    Tile Size:
        When Tile Method is set to Tile Size, this controls the resolution used for cutting up the heightfield into tiles.
    Number of Tiles:
        When Tile Method is set to Number of Tiles, this controls the number of tiles the heightfield will be cut up into.
    Tile Overlap:
        This controls the number of shared voxels that will overlap on the tile borders.
    File Naming:
        Determines the file naming used for each tile. Either based on UDIM, UV Tile, Frames or XY Tile.
    UDIM Stride:
        Limits the maximum number of UDIM stride width used.
    Pad Tile Numbers:
        The padding used for tile numbers.
    == Layers ==
    Export All Layers:
        Enables/Disabled the exporting of all maps as opposed to filtering them using the "Export Layers" multiparm.
    Export Layers:
        Allows you to manually specify which layers you want to export.
    Name:
	This allows you to specify the name used of the heightfield primitive that has to be exported.
