""" Convert a Grayscale Image Into a Normal Map  """

Converting a grayscale image into a normal map is a common task in Game Development. 

[Image:/images/normal_map.png]

NOTE:
	Similar functionality exists in the [Gradient COP|Node:cop2/gradient], but we found that the discoverability wasn't high enough and it justified a standalone node.

This node aids in that tasks with a few different options. 

@parameters
    Strength:
        Modulates the intensity of the normal resulting normal map. 
    Blur Strength:
        Additional blurring that can be used to fake beveling in the normal map
    Flip X:
        Invert the Red Channel
    Flip Y:
        Invert the Green Channel, useful in case your renderer is expecting a different type of normal map.
