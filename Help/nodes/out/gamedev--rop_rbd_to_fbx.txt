""" This tool allows for fast export of an RBD Sim to bone based FBX """

The RBD to FBX ROP takes in an RBD simulation containing packed primitives and extracts their transforms. These transforms are then later used to generate bones for each packed primitive for export to FBX.

@parameters
    Render:
        Hitting this button will start the conversion process and write the FBX to disk.
    == Settings ==
    Export as Empty Transforms:
        Enabling this toggle will only export animated transforms without any geometry data attached.
    Node To Export:
        This should be set to the sop containing the RBD simulation you want to export. For example your dopimport sop.
    Export Path:
        This is the path specifying where your FBX will be saved to.
    Start/End/Inc:
        Allows you to set your desired export frame range.
    Isolate Group:
        With this parameter you can specify to only export packed primitives from a certain group.
    == Advanced ==
    Use Custom Transform Attribute:
        If you want to use a custom attribute value to drive the scale of the packed primitives, you can enable to do so here.
    Scale Attribute:
        Allows you to specify which attribute to use for overriding of the scaling of the packed primitives.
    Override Name:
        You can give the generated pieces inside the FBX a custom name. Useful if you have a certain naming convention to adhere to.
    Name Override:
        Allows you to set the name override of the generated pieces.
