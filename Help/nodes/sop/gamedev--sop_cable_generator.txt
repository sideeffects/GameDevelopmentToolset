""" Given a curve that represents the high 'pin' points and low 'sag' points of a cable, this sop will generate sagging cables, with user definable cable count, shape, colour.  """

@parameters
    Number of Cables:
        Number of cables to generate.
    == Shape Controls ==
    Tension:
        How much tension each curve has.  A flat graph means all cables have the same tension. Bottom of the ramp means sagged tight cables. Top of the ramp means tight cables. The default curve means about 70% of the cables will be sagged, remaining 30% increasinly taut. 
    Horizontal Slack:
        Smoothing that doesn't affect vertical cable sag.
    General Smoothing:
        Overall smoothing, useful when large amounts of noise are applied.
    Joint Smoothing:
        Soften cable ability to reach target pin points.
    Chance To Skip Pin:
        Frequency of pin 'misses', allowing for more chaotic cable layouts.
    == Noise Options ==
    Noise Frequency:
        Noise frequency applied to cable positions.
    Noise_Amplitude:
        Noise amplitude applied to cable positions.
    == Sweep Options ==
    Radial Divisions:
        Numnber of sides to cable cross section, default is 12.
    Curve Resolution:
        Step size used in resample sop to generate cable paths. Lower numbers = higher quality.
    Radius Min Max:
        Min and max of cable radius, each cable will pick a random number between these values.
    UV Scale:
        UV layout dimensions. Small numbers work best to start with, say 0.2 for U and V, then append a UV layout sop to adjust with more control.
    == Detangle ==
    Detangle:
        Enable sop based detangling. Works best with enough noise and randomness in the initial cable layout to allow room for a successful detangle to happen.
    Detangle Iterations:
        Number of iterations for detangle operation.
    Post Detangle Smooth:
        Number of smoothing iterations applied after detangling.
    == Vertex Colors ==
    Add Vertex Colors:
        Enable false coloring for visualisation and id maps.
    Attribute Ramp:
        Control color of cables when add vertex colors toggle enabled.
