""" Deforms a mesh based on a sine wave curve """

Sine Waves are a very common way of animating objects. Flags, Fishes, Waves, Flags, and many other objects can be cheapily animated by just running a sine wave through them. 

This saves you from diving into a pointWrangle and setting up a bunch of expressions

The node lets you specify the primary direction of the sine wave, and then allows you to control two separate waves on moving on the other 2 axis. 
Generally speaking the second item is the one you probably want to edit as it's perpendicular to the axis you chose, while the first one is tangential. 


@parameters
    Group:
        Localize the operation to a subset of the geometry
    Group Type:
        Specify the type of geometry to be isolated
    Mask Attribute:
        Option to attenuate the effect based on an attribute, commonly done with a vertex color 
    Axis:
        What is the primary axis of the effect. 
    Speed:
        How fast the wave is moving (tangent, perpendicular). Remember to turn on the realtime Toggle on your playbar to see the correct motion. 
    Offset:
        Optional shift on the sine wave in order to not have several on the same cadence. (tangent, perpendicular)
    Intensity:
        Strength (Amplitude) of the wave (tangent, perpendicular).
    Frequency:
        How closely together are the humps of the curve (tangent, perpendicular).
