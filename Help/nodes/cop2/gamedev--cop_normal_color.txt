""" Simple Helper Node to generate the default Normal Color """

Generates a default flat normal color (128, 128, 255) at the desired resolution. 

Normal information is from a -1 to 1, which means that in a image, that value goes from 0-1 with .5 being the "Zero" value. 

Flat Normal Maps are set to .5, .5, 1 (or 128, 128, 255) which is what this nodes provides

TIP: 
	Useful for blending in with other normal nodes.
