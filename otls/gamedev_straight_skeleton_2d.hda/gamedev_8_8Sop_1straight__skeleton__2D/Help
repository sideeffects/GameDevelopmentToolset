""" Generate the central curve (straight skeleton) for 2D input shapes. """

== Overview ==

Given some flat geometry, it’s often useful to find the curve that represents the center line of that geometry, called the straight skeleton. Uses include bevelling text, defining the top edge for a house roof, center line for roads and paths.

@parameters
    Resample Size:
        Resample the input and output curves
    Trim Ends:
        Remove the Y end pieces that are common in straight skeletons
    Threshold:
        Size Threshold for deleting the end pieces
    Fit to Shape:
        Extends the skeleton ends torwards the original curve
