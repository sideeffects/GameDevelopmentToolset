""" The flowmap obstacle SOP allows for easy modifications on the flowmap based on geometry. """

The flowmap obstacle SOP makes adding obstacles or modifications based on geometry very easy. Plug in your flowmap and obstacle geometry, and the tool will automatically adjust your flowmap procedurally.


@parameters
    Strength:
        Controls the intensity of the effect of guide on the already existing flowmap.
    Division Size:
        The division size controls how precise the sampling of the obstacle for the flowmap influence is.
    Dilate Volume:
        The dilate parameter allows you to dilate and erode the obstacle influence on the flowmap.
    Blur Strength:
        The blur strength controls how much blurring has to be applied to the generated influence prior to mixing with the incoming flowmap data.
