""" Consolidates Small UV Islands into Larger Neighbors """

[UV Unwrap|Node:sop/uvunwrap] is a great way of getting automatic UVs on your models, but tends to generate a lot of small disconnected islands in the process. 

This SOP aims to combat those small islands, and iteratively merge them back up to the closest largest neighboring island.

@parameters
    UV Attribute:
        UV attribute to operate on
    Initial Fuse Dist:
        There is a built in intial Fuse Node to ensure good island connectivity, this is the distance threshold for that operation. 
    Cutoff:
        Size threshold of the islands that will be merged back into larger pieces
    Flattening Method:
        Method for reflattening the islands based on the new seams
    Iterations:
        Attempts at merging the islands together. Higher values produce smoother results
    Optimize UV Border:
        Attempts to cleanup triangles that are sticking to the side of the UV island. May cause small islands to reappear
