""" Create a geometry 'skirt' where an object and ground plane intersect, to be used as a soft blend in a game engine. """

:video:
    #src:opdef:.?dirtskirt.mp4

Level design for game engines often require geometry to be intersected with the ground plane, but can look harsh and disconnected. A smoothed ring of geometry around the intersection region can help blend the geometry into the ground plane.

The dirt skirt sop can create this blending geometry, with controls over the extent and quality of the blend.

@parameters
    == Object Skirt ==
    Distance:
        Distance on the object the skirt will reach
    Noise Frequency:
        Noise on the object portion of the skirt. High Frequency means tighter noise 
    Noise Intensity:
        Strength of the noise on the object portion of the skirt
    == Ground Skirt ==
    Distance:
        Distance on the ground the skirt will reach
    Noise Frequency:
        Noise on the ground portion of the skirt. High Frequency means tighter noise 
    Noise Intensity:
        Strength of the noise on the ground portion of the skirt    
    == Tweak Parameters ==
    Relaxation Iterations:
        Amount to relax the inner surface of the skirt. Higher values will even out the topology, creating a softer blend.
    Ground Offset:
        Vertical height to offset start of dirt skirt above the ground geometry. 
    Rotate X:
        Rotation on X to slump the dirt skirt higher on +Z or -Z.
    Rotate Z:
        Rotation on Z to slump the dirt skirt higher on +X or -X.
    Add Vertex Color:
        When enabled will add a gradient to the edges of the dirt skirt. When exported to a game engine this can be used as alpha fade, or a mask to blend between materials used for the object and the ground.
    == Clean Up ==
    Target Polycount:
        Total amount of polygons to be used in the skirt, default is 1000.
    Delete Small Area Threshold:
        Area threshold used to identify small triangles and delete them.
    Z Offset:
        Amount to push all points along their normals, to avoid intersections with the ground or object mesh.
    Keep Ground Mesh:
        When enabled will include the ground mesh in the output geometry.
    Keep Object Mesh:
        When enabled will include the object mesh in the output geometry.
