""" Interactive Stashing of Edge Selections """

This node creates edge groups based on viewport selection. Select edges or primitives in the viewport and then hit the `Mark Selection` button, which will stash your selection choice in this node. 

One handy feature is to use primitive selections, in which case the node will store the boundary of that primitive group. 

WARNING:
    This node has been deprecated since the UV Flatten node now has this functionality built into the state.
