This node will generate several smaller boxes contained inside the input mesh's bounding box. 

Useful for slicing up meshes or point clouds based on a grid that is based on the bounding box.

@parameters
    Divisions:
        Number of sub components in each axis 
    Isolate Index:
        Isolate a single bounding box 
    Index:
        Which bounding box to isolate. Helpful to put $F as an expression here and slice up the model in several submodels based on the frame with a ROP.
