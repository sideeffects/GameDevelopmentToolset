""" Simple Interface to Change the Timing of an animation """


This SOP will alow you to easily retime an animation with an intuitive interface. 

It is simple by design, but allows for really powerful and fine control over the animation timing, allowing for slowmotions and speed ups to be easily done.

    Retimed Animation 

@parameters
    Global Retime:
        General Timing Rescale over the whole sequence
    Retiming Ramp:
        The main heart of the SOP. By default the ramp is linear from 0-1. 
        
        The way to control the playback is to add additional points in the curve that can either change the curve so it's below the original or above the original. 
        
        If the curve is below the mid line, the animation will play slower than the original, if it's above the line it'll play faster.
