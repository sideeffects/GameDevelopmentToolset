#Game Development Toolset

This is a series of tools and examples geared towards assisting Houdini users with a variety of tasks for game development. 

The idea is that this will be a live repository of common examples and tools that aid game developers on a day to day basis. Tools that gain enough traction here will then be added to the main build and become a part of the regular installation. 

If you'd like more information, please check out the [wiki](https://github.com/sideeffects/GameDevelopmentToolset/wiki)!

NOTE: This is very much under construction. Please file an [Issue](https://github.com/sideeffects/GameDevelopmentToolset/issues) if something doesn't seem quite right! Guidelines can be found [here](https://github.com/sideeffects/GameDevelopmentToolset/wiki/How-to-contribute!).

NOTE: This is a significantly different setup than it was before, for the original GameDevelopmentToolset look into the Houdini15.0 branch. 

##Instructions
Treat this as you would a wiki or a documentation website. Individual Tools and Examples will be linked under Specific Categories in order for you to download only what you need
