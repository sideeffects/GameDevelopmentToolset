""" Generate Buildings from OSM Data """

[Open Street Map|https://www.openstreetmap.org] is an open source XML based file format for City Map data. 

The OSM Buildings Node extrudes building data from curves generated by the [OSM Import SOP|Node:sop/gamedev--sop_osm_import].

For a curve to be eligible it needs to be tagged as a building and have a `height` or `building:levels` tag. If not, the `Generate Buildings on Missing Data` can take shapes that are tagged as buildings and do an approximation. 

Building Parts are also represented properly. This is usually present in landmark or complex buildings that are more intricate than a single extrusion. 

TIP:
	Also see the [OSM Import SOP|Node:sop/gamedev--sop_osm_import], [OSM Filter SOP|Node:sop/gamedev--sop_osm_filter] and [MapBox SOP|Node:sop/gamedev--sop_mapbox] for more OSM related workflows. 

@parameters
    Shrink Footprints:
        Distance to shrink the building footprints down. This is helpful for using the building footprints as sidewalks.
    Boolean Buildings:
        Union adjecent buildings together. Turns city blocks into single buildings. 
    Visualize Buildings:
        Colorizes individual buildings as different colors
    Generate Buildings on Missing Data:
        Generate buildings even if not all required data is present (height or building:levels)
    Random Seed:
        Different seed for the random building heights
    Height Range:
        Min and Max Range for the randomly generate buildings
