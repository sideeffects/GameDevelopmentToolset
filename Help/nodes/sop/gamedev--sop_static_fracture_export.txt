""" The Static Fracture SOP takes static geometry data from sop level, and separates them into newly generated geometry containers on object level """

The Static Fracture SOP takes static geometry data from sop level, and separates them into newly generated geometry containers on object level, based on a piece attribute. You can therefore use it to quickly generate static geometry containers for further modifications ob /obj level, or to simply export this as an FBX to be used in The Nvidia Physx lab tool, or any game engine. 

@parameters
    == Export Settings ==
    Frame To Export:
        Specify which frame to export. Note that this tool does not export animation data.
    Container Name:
        This sets the name of the generated subnet containing the fracture data.
    Export Mode:
        This toggle allows you to pick between exporting based on Packed Primitives (One container per packed primitive), or based on a Piece Attribute (For example class or name).
    Prim Piece Attribute:
        If Export Mode is set to Piece Attribute, this allows you to specify what attribute that is. (Typically class or name)
    == Export ==
    Static Export:
        This triggers the export to OBJ level using the above settings.
