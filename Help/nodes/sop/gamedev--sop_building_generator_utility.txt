""" Create base modules to use with the building generator, as well as override base module behavior. """

The gamedev building generator requires collections of named geometry. These collections are named 'wall', 'corner', 'top_ledge', and are referred to as modules. This node assists in the creation of these modules.

As well as setting module names and dimensions, this sop can also do localized overrides.

The handplaced override tab allows a module to ignore the building generator rules, and have its own transform defined.

The volumetric override tab will use the second input as a spatial override; if a part of a building intersects with this geometry, the specified module will be used instead.

@parameters
    == Building Module ==
    Module Name:
        Module to apply within the bounding box(es) connected to the second input.
    Module Dimensions:
        Target width and height of module in Houdini units. This is manually defined as the automatic bounds may not correspond to intent; eg flagpoles that extend away from the module surface.
    == Handplaced Overrides ==
    Action:
        Display or hide the bounding box reference.
    Use Embedded Boundingbox:
        Enable the bounding box utility to visually set the dimensions of this handplaced module.
    === Bounds Properties ===
    Center:
        Center of module.
    Size:
        Size of module.
    Uniform Scale:
        Uniform scale of module, the 3-value scale is multiplied by this value.
    Rotate:
        Rotation of this module.
    == Building Module ==
    Module Name:
        Module to apply within the bounding box(es) connected to the second input.
