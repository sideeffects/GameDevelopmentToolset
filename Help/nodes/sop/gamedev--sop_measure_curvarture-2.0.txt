""" Generates Point Colors based on the Curvature of the Model """

Measures the Curvature of a model and outputs it as Point Colors. 

Handy for all types of calculations, including scattering and polyreduction. Curvature is one of the fundamental mesh properties and is generally useful. 

By Default, green will represent Convex colors and Red will represent Concave colors. Unless `Single Color Value` is set. 

NOTE: 
    This node doesn't still make use of the new Measure 2.0 SOP capabilities.

@parameters
    == Curvature Values ==
    Calculate Per Piece:
        Toggle the calculations as a whole or as diconnected pieces
    Method:
        Dropdown with several algorithms (some provided by community user Petz) 
    Voxel Size:
        For Voxel based calculations, adjust the size of the voxel grid
    == Convex Adjustment ==
    Range Scale:
        Multiply the range of the Convex Colors, similar to an intensity control, but before contrast/intensity are run
    Contrast:
        Tighten the contrast on the colors
    Intensity:
        Another multiplier on the colors
    Blur Amount:
        Optional Blur to soften the colors 
    == Concave Adjustment ==
    Range Scale:
        Multiply the range of the Convex Colors, similar to an intensity control, but before contrast/intensity are run
    Contrast:
         Tighten the contrast on the colors
    Intensity:
        Another multiplier on the colors
    Blur Amount:
        Optional Blur to soften the colors 
        
    == Extra Settings ==
    Visualize As Color:
        Output the Paramters as the Cd attribute
    Single Color Value:
        Toggle between the red/green output or a single value
    Fit To 0-1:
        Clamp the output between 0-1
