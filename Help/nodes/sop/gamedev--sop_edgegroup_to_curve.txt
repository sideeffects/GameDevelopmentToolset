""" Converts an Edge Group to a Poly Curve """

Edge Groups are a handy way of defining curves, but the process of extracting them from a mesh is not trivial, until now. 

This node will take an Edge Group, and convert it into a PolyCurve.

It will also provide an additional option to give the extracted curve some thickness. Useful for visualizing UV seams and other screenshotting purposes.
