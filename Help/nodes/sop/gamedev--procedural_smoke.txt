""" The procedural smoke SOP will generate an animated volume to represent smoke. """

The purpose of this node is to quickly generate rolling smoke that can be used as a background element or texture sheet in a game. Instead of simulating the smoke, the tool creates points with animated noise values on them. These points are rasterized into a volume and a second layer of noise is used to created finer detail.

@parameters
    Size:
        Size of the bounding box along the xyz axes.
    Center:
        Position of centre of bounding box.
    Point Separation:
        The smallest distance between any two of the generated points in the initial configuration.
    Density Boost:
        Multiply the final output of the volume.
    Preview:
        To block out movement quickly turn this on to see the points instead of the volume.
    == Base Noise ==
    == Base Noise 1 ==
    Pulse Duration:
        Time rate of change of the noise pattern is inversely proportional to __Pulse Duration__. 
    Element Size:
        Controls base feature size of the generated noise. 
    Element Scale:
        Feature size along each axis is governed by the product of __Element Size__ with the applicable component of this parameter.
    Horizontal Speed:
        How quickly the noise is offset along the x axis.
    Vertical Speed:
        Only available when __Oscillate__ is turned off. How quickly the noise is offset along the y axis.
    Oscillate:
        When turned on, the noise will move up and down with a sin function.
    Amplitude:
        The amplitude of the sin function when oscilatting.
    Speed:
        How quickly the noise will oscillate.

    == Detail ==
    Add Detail:
        Turning on __Add Detal__ will multiply the base volume by a high frequency noise. 
    Noise Type:
        Different noise types to choose from.
    Frequency:
        Size of the noise pattern in xyz axes.
    Roughness:
        This sharpens or softens the edge of the noise.
    Turbulence:
        The number of octaves of noise to layer.
    ramp:
        The shape of the ramp is multiplied by the noise result.
    Oscillate Amplitude:
        The amplitude of the sin function when oscilatting.
    Oscillate Speed:
        How quickly the noise will oscillate.
    == Falloff ==
