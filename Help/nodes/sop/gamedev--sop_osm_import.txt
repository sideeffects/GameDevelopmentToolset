""" Imports Open Street Map Data """

[Open Street Map|https://www.openstreetmap.org] is an open source XML based file format for City Map data. 

The OSM Import node parses OSM files and converts them into Houdini geometry.

TIP: 
	Also see the [OSM Filter SOP|Node:sop/gamedev--sop_osm_filter], [OSM Buildings SOP|Node:sop/gamedev--sop_osm_buildings] and [MapBox SOP|Node:sop/gamedev--sop_mapbox] for more OSM related workflows. 

NOTE:
	All of the OSM Tags are parsed and stored as primitive attributes, hop over to the geometry spreadsheet to see more info about the data you imported.
