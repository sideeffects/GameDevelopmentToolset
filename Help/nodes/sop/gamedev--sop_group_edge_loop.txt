""" Converts an Edge Group to the respective loops """

This node takes in a mesh with an Edge group as an input, and expands the edge group into the respective edge loops. 

The Edge Group should have at least *two edges*, to determine the direction of the loop. 

TIP:
    If *two parallel edges* are provided the SOP will return an edge ring instead. 

@parameters
    Group:
        Edge Group to be modified   
    Override Name:
        Toggle if a new group should be created instead of modifying the input group
    New Name:
        If Override Name is toggled, this describes the name of the new group
    Step:
        This generates a pattern on the Loop. Number of edges to skip in between each selected edge.
