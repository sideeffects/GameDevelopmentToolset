""" Reorders Vector Components """

Swizzling is the act of reordering the components of a vector. 

This is common in changing coordinate systems, where the Z axis becomes the Y axis. 

This node will allow you to both swizzle the components, and also flip individual components. 

TIP:
    If you're going from Y up to Z up you want to swizzle Y and Z and Flip the X to -X 

@parameters
    Coordinates:
        Positional values to be changed.
    Swizzle Coord:
        Swizzel all the possible XYZ combinations.
    Flip Coord:
        Inverse any of the possible XYZ combinations.
    Invert:
        For reversing the negations.
