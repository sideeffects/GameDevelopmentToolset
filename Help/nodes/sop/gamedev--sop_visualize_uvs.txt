""" Different methods of visualizing UV Data """

This node behaves similarly to the UV QuickShade with a few more upgrades. 

It is designed to visualize the UV coordinates of your mesh by applying a grid texture to it and tiling a few times. 

You can also identify the different UV Islands and visualize the UV Seams

WARNING:
    This will change your UVs, be aware if you link any nodes as your output 
    
    
@parameters
    Group:
        Isolate Visualization to this primitive group
    Grid Texture:
        Override for the displayed grid texture
    Grid Tiling:
        Number of tiles the grid texture will be repeated
        
        WARNING:
            This will change your UVs, be aware if you link any nodes as your output 
    Visualize Islands:
        Colorizes the individual UV Islands
    View in Worldspace:
        Moves the points based on their UVs in WorldSpace. Effectively pelting them in 3d Space. Useful for tracking which island matches which piece of geometry. 
    Blend:
        Blend between the original mesh, and the UV Space version of the mesh 
    Visualize Seams:
        Toggle the UV Seams as Geometry
    Thickness:
        Thickness of the UV Seams Mesh
