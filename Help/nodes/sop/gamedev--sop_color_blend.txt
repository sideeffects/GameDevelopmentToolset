""" Blends Color data on 2 separate meshes based on common algorithms """

This node is designed to blend between 2 `Cd` attributes from separate meshes. 

The `blend` parameter has a few different modes: 
	* *Linear* Traditional blending where 0 means the first color and 1 means the second 
	* *Multiply* Multiplies both colors together 
	* *Overaly* Multiplies dark colors and adds lights colors 
	* *Screen* Adds the second color into the first as if you were projecting the second color through a light. 
	* *Add* Add both colors together 
	* *Darken* Choose the darkest of the 2 colors for a specified point 
	* *Lighten* Choose the lightest of the 2 colors for a specified point 
	* *Difference* Subtract the second color from the first color

@inputs 
Input Mesh:
	Base Mesh that will have it's color modified

Additional Mesh:
	Secondary Mesh to Blend with 

(Optional) Mask Mesh:
	Additional Mesh that will have it's `Cd` attribute multiplied against the blending parameter.
