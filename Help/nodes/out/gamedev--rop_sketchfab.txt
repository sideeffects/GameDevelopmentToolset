""" Uploads geometry to Sketchfab """

[Sketchfab|http://www.sketchfab.com] is a popular website where users can upload meshes and animations and preview them on any browser. 

This node will export your data to FBX and upload it to Sketchfab, including your PBR textures. 

We have recently updated this node to support animations including Skinning Converter outputs.
