""" Rotates a Normal Map while correcting recalculating it's internal vectors """

A traditional Xform is not the correct way of rotating a normal map. Because a normal map represents directions and not colors, the red/green/blue channels always need to be the correct representation of the Tangent, Binormal and Normal Axis.

Isolating only the green channel will be a better way to see what is happening. Ignore the background issues on the Xform node.
