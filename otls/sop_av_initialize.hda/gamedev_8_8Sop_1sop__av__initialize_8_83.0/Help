""" Configure which images to process using Alicevision. """

This node is the start of the AliceVision node-network, and where you add your images. Simply click 'Add Images' and a dialog will launch in order for you to select your chosen images. The image list is then stored as a detail attribute and will be passed on to the next nodes. It is therefore essential this node is always part of you network.

After you have added the images, set the Cache Directory and Project Name. The project name will ensure a new Cache Directory subfolder, meaning it will not overwrite previously processed data.

@parameters
    == Main ==
    Cook:
        Start the cooking process for this step.
    Manual Mode:
        This toggle controls if the node should automatically recook if any dependencies have changed.
    Use Log:
        This toggle controls if the status of the current node should be printed to the console. This is useful for getting a quick overview of the progress.
    Project Name:
        This is the project name that Alicevision will use for creating project files. It is important to have a unique project name per processed object to prevent accidental overwrites.
    Cache Directory:
        This directory will be used to store all the generated data. Removing this directory will undo any progress so far.
    Alicevision Directory:
        This can be used to point to the compiled binaries of Alicevision that should be used for processing.
