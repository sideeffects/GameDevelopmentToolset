""" Generates a curve based on the internal structure of a mesh """

A Straight Skeleton, or Medial Axis  is a method of defining an internal center line or skeleton for a mesh. 

There are several applications for this technique, from UVs, Destruction, Growth Solvers and Joint Generation.

TIP:
	You can use a Facet with the Remove Inline Points option to thin out the points

NOTE: 
	For a 2D approach take a look at the [GameDev Straight Skeleton 2D|Node:sop/gamedev--straight_skeleton_2D] and the [PolyExpand2D|Node:sop/polyexpand2d] nodes.
