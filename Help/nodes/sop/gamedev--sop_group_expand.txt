""" Grows or Shrinks a Group Selection """

This node will modify an input group by expanding or contracting it's size. 

This is usually accomplished by converting the group to primitives and back to points, but the setup to do this on a loop is not trivial. 

NOTE: 
    This node will likely be deprecated in Houdini 18.0 due to built in functionality.

@parameters
    Group:
        Group to modify
