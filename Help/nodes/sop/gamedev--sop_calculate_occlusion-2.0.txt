""" Vertex Based Ambient Occlusion Calculation """

Ambient Occlusion is a common operation where areas that are self occluded become darker. Traditionally this is done as a rendering step, but we've added this node to do it at the geometry level. 

This is very handy for doing several biased operations, like choosing the cost for a [shortest path algorithm|Node:sop/findshortestpath], biasing less [poly reduction|Node:sop/polyreduce] on occluded areas or increasing [scatter|Node:sop/scatter] density.

@inputs

Object To Recieve Occlusion:
    First Input, object to operate on.

Optional Occlusion Object:
    Additional Input that contributes to the occlusion calculation, but is not added to the geometry. Like an invisible shadow caster

@parameters
    == Occlusion Settings ==
    Number of Rays:
        How many samples to generate. Higher number means higher quality at the cost of speed. 
    Bias:
        Shifts the value fo the output, similar to an intensity sliders, but values closer to 0 means a stronger AO 
    == Advanced ==
    Maximum Ray Distance:
        Stop the AO Ray from going beyond this distance. Useful for removing artifacts of AO happening because of a far away object.
    Cone Width:
        How wide is the sampling, smaller numbers means tighter falloffs. 
    == Output ==
    Output Occlusion as Color ( Cd ):
        Toggle for the Occlusion to be written to the Cd (color) channel on Points. 
    Occlusion Attribute:
        If the above value is off, this is the override name for the output attribute. 
    Output curve:
        This curve lets you do basic levels operations on the AO to fine tune the results without needing to rerun the expensive AO calculations. 
    == Smoothing ==
    Method:
        Lets you choose the different blurring methods 
    Influence Type:
        This parameter determines how points see their neighbors 
    Blurring Iterations:
        Number of times the input geometry is blurred
    Blur Size:
        Size of each blurring iteration.
