""" Rotates the input geometry around itself based on the timeline """

This is a simple node that can be used to quickly setup turntable renders of your objects. 

It will rotate the object based on your start/end frames on your timeline and the specified number of turns. 

TIP:
	If you would like counter clockwise motion, set the number of turns to a negative value.
