""" The impostor tool creates texture sheets to fake 3D objects in your game engine. """

The impostor tool creates texture sheets to fake 3D objects in your game engine.  The tool will create full octahedral, 3D, fixed axis and animated impostors.  Below is a short video showing how to setup the tool in Houdini.

@parameters
    Render:
        Pressing this button will render the impostor to disk.
    == Base Settings ==
    Render in One Image:
        When this toggle is enabled, all frames of the impostor texture are generated with a lens shader instead of on a per frame basis.
    Impostor Type:
        This allows you to set the impostor type that has to be generated.
    Source Geometry:
        This needs to point to the geometry that should be rendered as an impostor.
    Camera Rig:
        This needs to point to an OBJ level camera rig.
    Sprite Resolution:
        This sets the sprite resolution. (Ex: If you have 8x8 frames at 128x128 pixels, this means a combined 1024x1024 pixel texture)
    XY Frames:
        Sets the number of XY frames that need to be generated for the impostor texture.
    Atlas Resolution:
        When Impostor Type is set to Octahedron, this controls the overall impostor texture resolution.
    Octahedron Zoom:
        This controls the camera zoom amount for the Octahedron impostor camera lens.
    Animation Frames:
        When Impostor Type is set to Animation, this controls how many frames you want to encode in the impostor.
    Output Picture:
        This specifies where the output texture will be saved.
    Output Geo:
        This specifies where the geometry generated for the Octahedral Impostor needs to be saved.
    == Atlas ==
    Pre Multiply:
        This controls if the basecolor/beauty map alpha channel should be premultiplied.
    Beauty Map:
        Enables/Disables the generation of the Beauty Atlas for the impostor.
    Beauty Atlas:
        This specifies where the Beauty Atlas should be saved to.
    Base Color Map:
        Enables/Disables the generation of the Base Color Atlas for the impostor.
    Base Color Atlas:
        This specifies where the Base Color Atlas should be saved to.
    Normals Map:
        Enables/Disables the generation of the Normal Atlas for the impostor.
    Normals Atlas:
        This specifies where the Normal Atlas should be saved to.
