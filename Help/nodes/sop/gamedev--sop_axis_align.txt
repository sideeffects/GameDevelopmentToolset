""" Aligns Objects based on the Bounding Box """

This simple node helps with the common tasks or recentering or realigning meshes. 

It uses Justification style parameters to center or justify right/left, similar to how word processors set the alignment on text.

It was designed as a replacement for having to type $CEX or $MINX in a transform SOP since centering and aligning are very common operations.

NOTE: 
    A lot of the functionality of this node has been ported over to the [Match Size SOP|Node:sop/matchsize]
