""" Quickly Spot Heal a Mesh """

This node will delete selected primitives, cap the generated hole and optionally remesh and reproject the patch onto the original. 

This is designed to cleanup scanned assets that might have knots of other problematic topology. It is essentially a localized remeshing to smooth out a problem area in your mesh. 

@parameters
    Base Group:
        Polygons to delete/repair 
    Fill Mode:
        How to fill the hole that is created
    == Remesh ==
    Post Remesh:
        Remesh the patch that was generated. The Fill Mode Parameter must be set to Single Polygon for this option to be enabled.  
    Target Edge Length:
        Optimal length for the remesh edges
    Reproject onto Original:
        Raycast the patch onto the original geometry in order to get some of the original detail back 
    == Smoothing ==
    Smooth Borders:
        Soften the edges to smooth the transition onto the original mesh 
    Influence:
        How far to blur the edge into the original mesh 
    Blurring Iterations:
        How many times to run the blurring algorithm
